I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a deep specialization in **Drupal**. I have worked extensively with all versions from **Drupal 7 up to the latest, Drupal 11**. My expertise isn't limited to Drupal; I also have a strong command of PHP frameworks like **Laravel**.

On the **frontend** side, I navigate fluently between **React** and **Vue.js**, and I've built dynamic user experiences using modern frameworks such as **Next.js**, **Nuxt.js**, and **Astro**.

Currently, I'm focused on staying at the cutting edge, constantly updating myself with the **latest modern frontend technologies and frameworks**, with a particular emphasis on **TypeScript** for building safer and more maintainable applications.
